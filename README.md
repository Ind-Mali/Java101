### The other apps uploaded by one by

1. ## findnumber.java
- We can find the **smallest** number or **largest** number which is given from keyboard.
- When the given number is finish the app is shut down.
- If you give one number the app return max and min number the same which is given number.

2. ## perfectnumber.java
- Firstly, you have to give a number then this app control whether this number is perfect or not.

3. ## uppertriangel.java
- We can find upper traingel stars. 

4. ## primenumber.java
- If you give the number interval, the app would give whether the number is a prime number or not.

5. ## fibbo.java
- This app will return fibonacci series.

6. ## PalindromMethot.java 
- A palindromic number (also known as a numeral palindrome or a numeric palindrome) is a number (such as 16461) that remains the same when its digits are reversed.
- I  started to write method with this app.
- This app will throw back false or true when the given number is a palindrome.
- Firstly, I started to code with a static number but after that, I wanted to take a dynamic number from the keyboard.

7. ## AdvanceCalculate.java
- This advanced calculation app includes factorial, mod Retrieval, and exponent calculator.
- I try to learn how can I apply the **method** to our app.

8. ## RecursiveExp.java
- This app recursive method for exponantial.
- The classic example of recursive programming involves computing factorials. The factorial of a number is computed as that number times all of the numbers below it up to and including 1. For example, factorial(5) is the same as 5*4*3*2*1, and factorial(3) is 3*2*1.

9. ## RecursivePrime.java
- We can check the given number is prime or not. 
- There is a recursive method inside the code.

10. ## PatternwithNumber.java
- If the number is positive and equal 0, the number is decremented by **5** digits.
- If the number is negative and equal 0, the number is incremented   by **5** digits.
- Each step is printed to the console.

11. ## FindMinandMax.java

- Firstly, We determine the length of the array based on the value received from the user.
- We take the number from keyboard.
- We sort them in the array
- We take the number which want to check.
- The app return the **nearest number smaller** than the entered number and the **nearest number greater** than the entered number.

12. ## Letter.java
- This application returns that do letters from stars.
- There are forEach and for loops.

13. ## RepetitiveNumber.java

- This app returns numbers which are even number inside the array.
- For examples; The array consist of ***int[] arr = { 3, 7, 3, 2, 9, 10, 21, 1, 33, 9, 1, 2, 4, 22, 12, 12, 22 };***, return numbers 2, 22, 12.

14. ## GuessesNumberGame.java

- We have 5 rights.
- When We enter the wrong number our right decrease and the wrong number append the array. The app returns us the our right.
- If We enter the right number the app returns us You won.
- At the end of the game, If We do not guess the right number, the app returns us that we lose.
