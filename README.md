### The other apps uploaded by one by

1. ## findnumber.java
- We can find the **smallest** number or **largest** number which is given from keyboard.
- When the given number is finish the app is shut down.
- If you give one number the app return max and min number the same which is given number.

2. ## perfectnumber.java
- Firstly, you have to give a number then this app control whether this number is perfect or not.

3. ## uppertriangel.java
- We can find upper traingel stars. 

4. ## primenumber.java
- If you give the number interval, the app would give whether the number is a prime number or not.

5. ## fibbo.java
- This app will return fibonacci series.

6. ## PalindromMethot.java 
- A palindromic number (also known as a numeral palindrome or a numeric palindrome) is a number (such as 16461) that remains the same when its digits are reversed.
- I  started to write method with this app.
- This app will throw back false or true when the given number is a palindrome.
- Firstly, I started to code with a static number but after that, I wanted to take a dynamic number from the keyboard.

7. ## AdvanceCalculate.java
- This advanced calculation app includes factorial, mod Retrieval, and exponent calculator.
- I try to learn how can I apply the **method** to our app.

8. ## RecursiveExp.java
- This app recursive method for exponantial.
- The classic example of recursive programming involves computing factorials. The factorial of a number is computed as that number times all of the numbers below it up to and including 1. For example, factorial(5) is the same as 5*4*3*2*1, and factorial(3) is 3*2*1.
